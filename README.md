## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Neural Network Basics  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Transfer Learning  
- TensorFlow 2.x Implementation  

## ðŸ”§ Installation  
To run the notebooks, install the required dependencies:  

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-lear
```

### Alternatively, use the requirements.txt file
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
